# Learning Git
//This Repo is to learn and practice how to use Git and Github

## What is Git?
//git is s version control system, We use it to maintain the history of our projects as well as the different versions of it.

## What is a commit?
  Acts as a checkpoint for our projects. Its a snapshot of our project during that point in time. We can use **commits** to roll back changes to that point. **Commits** are how we keep track of our project's history.

## What is a push?
Pushing allows us to move any new commits to a remote repository. SO in this case, we can push our commits to github.

## What are branches?
BRanches are different version of our repo created from a commit. They allow us to work on different versions of our project simultaneously with others and keep our work independent. Master/Main branch is usually the default branch with the most changes.

## What is merging?
Merging is taking the code form one branch and merging it to another. Usually we'll have feature branches that branch out of the main branch and we'll merge once the feature is complete.
